        <h2>Welcome to Pizza University!</h2>

          <p>One of the most well loved foods in the world is pizza. It can be everything from cheese only, cheese with vegetables, to fully loaded with multiple kinds of meats and vegetables.  From thick crust to thin crust, and regional styles like New York, New Jersey tomato pies, New Haven Clam, and Detroit Red Top. Further variations include Sicilian, Californian, and Napoletana.  The Italian have at least 7 regional varieties as well. There are even desert "pies". What is not to like?</p>

          <p>Pizza is fairly simple. It is just dough, tomatoes, cheese, and toppings.  But like a lot of things, you can take the craft of those ingredients as far as you want to take them. You can take the rest of your life refining these skills!</p>
          <p>Learning the craft of making pizza can be made better with a few extra steps, the right tools, a little extra time, and more practice. But if you are up for the challenge, the reward is great.</p>
          
          <p>Before you start making better pizzas, you are going to need a few basic tools and ingredients. There is an initial investment, but the tools basicly last forever and will make a discernible difference in your pizza making. In pizza you will discover that slow is the secret. Isn't it that way with so many things?</p>
          <p>This website is in part to my life long love for working in the kitchen. This has become even much more of a passion after my battle with stage IIIC stomach cancer, in which I was unable to eat for a long time and lost a major organ. During that year of depending on a feeding tube and limited food, I became a fan of the good and the simple. I hope to inspire the furthering of pizza knowledge with this example website!</p>
