        <p>Annual pizza sales in the United States is around 28 billion per year.</p>

        <h2>Technique Information</h2>
        <p>There are a few skills to be learned in making pizzas.  Like many skills, they can be done simply or take lifetime to refine. In my experience, the first things to learn would be: working with the dough, rolling out the crust, launching the pizza (moving the pizza pie to the baking surface), and baking tips.</p>
        <p>Working with the dough is the first item of business. After the dough has fermented for 24 to 72 hours, it is ready to ball.  Divide the dough into approximately 13 ounce pieces, and with both hands fold the dough in half.  Make a 45 degree turn with the dough, and repeat.  Do this 25 to 35 times until the dough ball has a smooth taught surface. To finish off, fold in half and seal the edges of the dough to trap the gas.  It is important that the dough is not torn while working it and that it is sealed tightly at the end. Place the dough ball on a cookie sheet and cover in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for another 24 hours. Remove from refrigeration 2 hours before use. </p>
        <p>The next technique is to open and stretch the dough.  The gluten network of the dough needs to be preserved, so do not punch down the dough or form back into a ball. Maintain the shape of the dough and move it to the counter for stretching. Make sure to dust the counter with a generous dusting mixture, it is hard to over dust.  Place dough on the counter, dust the dough.  Flip and repeat.  Press down the dough with your fingers, starting around 3/4 inch from the edge.  Leave a thicker rim for an edge.  Start sliding your hands apart from each other to stetch the dough.  As it stretches, move to holding the dough on top of your fist and flip it from hand to hand and continue to stretch.  Continue to stretch over the fist by pulling both fists apart and turning.  As the dough is continuing to stretch, it can be moved to a dusted peel and a rolling pin can be used as well.  After sufficient stretching, it is ready for building the pizza pie.</p>

        <p>Launching the pizza can be a learned skill, but make sure the peel is sufficiently dusted with a flour such as seminolia.  This acts like miniature ball bearings to the bottom of the pizza.  When the dough is on the peel, shake to make sure it is not adhered to the surface.  Then build the pizza on the peel and give the peel a good shake to slide the pizza off onto the baking surface.</p>
        <p>The most difficult part is done, now to the fun part!  Time to top that dough. Use a large spoon to smooth out the sauce, working from the center in a spiral. Leave a 3/4 inch margin around the edge. Give the peel a shake to make sure the dough is not sticking,and then proceed to top the pizza. Use around 6 ounces of shredded mozzarella cheese and evenly cover the sauce. Next arrange your meat, such as pepperoni, evenly over the cheese.  Add any other toppings to suit.</p>
        <p>For cooking, the best results are using the two pizza stone or baking steel method. Place the pizza on the top stone at 500 degrees on broil for 2 to 3 minutes.  If any bubbles appear, poke them with a fork and top that spot with extra cheese. Place the pizza back on the peel, rotate 180 degrees, and then put on the lower rack for around 5 minutes to finish. This will crisp the bottom. The cheese should be bubbly and nicely browned and the bottom nicely browned as well. Remove pizza with the peel, and slide it off on the cutting board.</p>
        <p>A good finishing touch to the pizza is to drizzle the pizza with garlic oil, Pecorino Romano cheese, and oregano.</p>
